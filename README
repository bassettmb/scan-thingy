main.sh may be invoked directly if ./local/bin is in the current path.

Results can be somewhat filtered automatically by running
./local/bin/filter.pl on the output directory.

Typical use will require booting the repo if it has not already been booted,
building and then running a scan.

Parameters dictating runtime behavior are defined in main.sh and may be
altered based on needs.
